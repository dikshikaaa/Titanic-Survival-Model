# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Model

The Titanic survival prediction model using machine learning is a model that uses historical data from the Titanic disaster to predict which passengers were most likely to survive. This type of model is typically built using supervised machine learning techniques, where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset containing information about the passengers, such as their age, gender, class, and fare.
